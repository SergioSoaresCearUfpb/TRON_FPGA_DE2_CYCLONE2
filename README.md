# TRON_FPGA_DE2_CYCLONE2
 Implementation project of the Light Cycles minigame on an Altera DE2 Cyclone 2 FPGA
## Overview
 recreation of the classic game "TRON", released in 1982, using an FPGA board to bring its gameplay to life. The implementation was carried out by simulating several codes in the Quartus II software. Developed for two players, the game's main objective is to awaken the interest of the public, especially children and teenagers, in the field of engineering, providing an interactive and educational experience.
